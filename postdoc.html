<p>I am an <font color="#cc0000">Assistant Professor at Harvard University</font> with appointments in Business School and Department of Computer Science. </p> 

<blockquote style=" padding: 10px; background-color: #eeeeee;"><font size="3">

         <p>My research interests lie within the broad area of <font color="#cc0000">trustworthy machine learning</font>. More specifically, my research spans <font color="#cc0000">explainable</font>, <font color="#cc0000">fair</font>,  and <font color="#cc0000">robust</font> ML. I am also very interested in <font color="#cc0000">reinforcement learning</font> and <font color="#cc0000">causal inference</font>.  

		 <p>I develop machine learning tools and techniques which enable human decision makers to make better decisions. More specifically, my research addresses the following fundamental questions pertaining to human and algorithmic decision-making:

	</p>

	<ol>

<li> How to build fair and interpretable models that can aid human decision-making?

<li> How to ensure that models and their explanations are robust to adversarial attacks? 

<li> How to train and evaluate models in the presence of missing counterfactuals?

<li> How to detect and correct underlying biases in human decisions and algorithmic predictions? 

</ol>

<p>These questions have far-reaching implications in domains involving high-stakes decisions such as criminal justice, health care, public policy, business, and education. 

<!--My research tackles the above questions by effectively handling the core underlying challenges such as missing counterfactuals and presence of unmeasured confounders.-->
