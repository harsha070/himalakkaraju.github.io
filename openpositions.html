<h3>Postdoctoral Fellowship Position</h3>
<font size="3">
		   <p><a href="https://himalakkaraju.github.io">Prof. Hima Lakkaraju</a> invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship position at Harvard University starting in the Spring/Summer of 2022. </p>

<p>
The selected candidate will be expected to lead research in novel machine learning methods. More specifically, this fellowship will focus on making theoretical and methodological advances at the intersection of explainable, fair, adversarial, and differentially private ML. 
</p>
<p>
We seek highly-motivated applicants with background in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, explainable ML, adversarial ML, fairness and differential privacy, statistical learning theory. Successful applicants will be strong technically as well as have an inclination towards real-world problems. 
		   </p>
<p>
We are looking for applicants with demonstrably strong research skills, ideally, with multiple publications in top venues in machine learning, artificial intelligence (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, UAI, FAccT, AIES), and/or top-tier interdisciplinary journals (e.g., Nature family of journals, PNAS). 
		   </p>
<p>
Candidates must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in computer science, statistics, or a closely related field. Strong programming skills and experience with machine learning and its applications are required.

<h3>Application Process</h3>

The position is available immediately and can be renewed annually. Interested applicants should apply via <a href="https://forms.gle/yCv6ZQ5mp76YyyuT7">this form</a> and submit the following documents:

<ul>
      <li>Curriculum Vitae (please include links to your academic webpage and any software you developed) </li>
      <li> Two representative publications (preprints are acceptable) </li>
      <li> Statement of Research (2 pages) describing prior research experience and future research plans </li>
      <li> Three letters of recommendation (will be solicited after the initial review) </li>
</ul>
We are currently reviewing applications for this position. Interested candidates are encouraged to submit their applications as soon as possible and preferably by <font color="#cc0000"><b>December 15, 2021</b></font>. We will continue accepting applications after this deadline if the position is not filled.
